WAVES2B by Luca G

The idea is to make a plugin that is much more customizable than waves2.

It works differently near and far from the center, in some circumstances.
This leads to (much!) more variety on your final images.

------------------------------------

To make it work like waves2;

1) Use identical values for scalex, scaleinfx (both equal to scalex).
2) And identical values for scaley, scaleinfy (both equal to scaley).
3) Use power=1. (pwx and pwy!!!)

Don't move too far from 1 if you like uniform spirals.
Else, you will get a "smoke effect" (cool) that may quickly go to a noise for high powers.
The effect is more strong far from the center.
Ideally you should use a range 0,3 to 2 (the spirals will be more various without strong distortion).

Use of negative powers is allowed but it leads to possibly weird results. (Noisy on some spots).

Other effect; Variation of scales depending on the distance from the center.
Many pretty effcets are possible. Works if & only if scales are different - scale and scaleinf.
The "unit" controls the speed of warping from scale to scaleinf.

------------------------------------

Additional controls - Special functions

You can also get new effects if you use this trick;

A very small value, like 0,00009, for waves2b_pwx or waves2b_pwy enables different functions...

But there is a big difference

If you chose 0,00009 as the power  you will render with Jacobi Elliptic function sn(x,k) - You can chose k from the variable waves2b_jacok (it affects the shapes).
If you chose -0,00009 as the power you will render with the function Bessel J1. The oscillation is muchly different from the sine oscillation.
