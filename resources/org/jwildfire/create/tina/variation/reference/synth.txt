Synth Explained
---------------

Synth is a variation partly inspired by old analogue synthesisers - the ones with 100s of knobs 
which you could use to alter the sound.

Synth is also the logical extension of ngon. Though in fact I designed synth first, then thought 
"this is crazy, no-one will program this for me", so I set my sights a lot lower with the design 
for ngon (which Joel Faber coded).

Basically, synth does the same thing as three other variations . . . spherical, bubble and blur,
but modifies the basic circle shape by using a waveform which you can control by changing the
many variables. This allows you to spice up old flames by substituting synth for one of your 
spherical, bubble or blur transforms.

There are 33 variables to tweak in synth, and it is difficult to use, so it is not recommended
for beginners or non-technical Apo users.

Also, be warned, synth is slow. All the variation plugins I write are slow . . . but sometimes the
results are worth it :-)


Synth variables
---------------

There are three "general" variables that affect the overall effect:

synth_a                The basic size of the circle shape to use. The default of 1.0 is often fine.

synth_power            Set to -2 to imitate spherical completely in mode 0, it affects the radial
                       "concentration" of the variation. Negative values are inside out, positive 
                       values push everything towards the centre. Other useful values are -1 for an
                       outline, or 0 for no effect at all. 
                       This variable has no use in mode 1 or "bubble mode"

synth_mode             Selects the basic variation that synth starts from

                       0 = "spherical mode"
                       1 = "bubble mode"
                       2 = "blur mode"
                       
                       Future versions of synth may have more options
                       
There are thirty variables that control the shape of the synth "waveforms" which distort the basic 
circle shape, and how they are combined. There are five possible waves labelled b, c, d, e and f, 
and each one uses the same six variables, so only b is shown here, the rest are just repeats:

synth_b                Amplitude. Size of effect from wave b. If set to 0 the wave is "switched off"

synth_b_type           Shape of the wave. There are currently 8 different shapes defined:

                       0 sine
                       1 cosine
                       2 square
                       3 sawtooth
                       4 triangle
                       5 concave
                       6 convex
                       7 ngon

synth_b_frq            Frequency of wave. A frequency of 1.0 repeats once around the circle. Whole
                       values are usually best, but the code supports any value

synth_b_skew           Skew effect, from -1.0 to 1.0. Set to 0.0, the wave has its default shape.
                       Set to -1.0 to get just the left hand side of the wave, set to 1.0 to get 
                       just the right hand side.

synth_b_phs            Phase of wave. Changing this value moves the wave shape around the circle.

synth_b_layer          Layering. Sets how this wave will combine with the shape made so far (this
                       is calculated in letter order, from wave b to f). There are currently 4 
                       layer modes defined:
                       
                       0 add
                       1 multiply
                       2 maximum
                       3 minimum


Suggestions For Use
--------------------

Probably the easiest way to search for synth shapes is to use "blur mode" (synth_mode = 2).

You then may have the problem of putting your nice new shape into the flame where you actually
want it.

The long way to do this is to note down the values you have used, and copy them into your target 
flame.

A quicker way I have found t is to edit the .flame file in Notepad. Do not do this if you are not 
comfortable editing HTML, XML or similar code.

The synth_examples.flame file contains some interesting shapes discovered by random generation. 
The shapes are all "duo-tone" versions, using two similar to show a bit more of the structure.


Duo-tone
---------

To create a "duo-tone" shape, use blur mode, and create an outline shape with synth_power = -0.9, 
and symmetry = -1.

Once you have the shape you want, duplicate the transform, then change one of the transforms to 
have synth_power = 0.5 and then edit the color to get a nice combination.

This describes all the modes available in Synth v2. Many of the modes
are so different to each other, it is best to think of them as different
variations, they just happen to share some of the same math.

MODES
-----

mode 0: spherical
-----------------

Modified version of spherical.

Set synth_power = 2.0, synth_mix = 0.0 to make it identical to spherical.

In this mode:

  synth_power is used to adjust radial effects.
  
  synth_smooth = 1 makes the shape closer to a circle near the centre or far 
    out.



mode 1: bubble
--------------

Modified version of bubble.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it identical to bubble.

In this mode:

  synth_power has no effect
  
  synth_smooth = 1 adjusts the outside of the bubble to the synth shape, but
    leaves the centre alone.



mode 2: blur (legacy)
---------------------

Creates a circular blur adjusted by the synth shape.

Set synth_power = 2.0, synth_mix = 0.0 to make it _close_ but not identical
to regular blur.

In this mode:

  synth_power is used to adjust radial effects.
  
  synth_smooth = 1 adjusts the unit circle into the synth shape, and 
    makes the variation less aggressive near the centre or far out.



mode 3: blur (new)
------------------

Creates a circular blur adjusted by the synth shape, similar to mode 2. The 
distribution is different, however, and mode 3 has less noticable "moire".

Set synth_power = 2.0, synth_mix = 0.0 to make it _close_ but not identical
to regular blur.

In this mode:

  synth_power is used to adjust radial effects.
  
  synth_smooth = 1 adjusts the unit circle into the synth shape, and 
    makes the variation less aggressive near the centre or far out.



mode 4: blur zigzag
--------------------

Creates a blur shape which is the raw waveform of the synth.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make a straight line.

In this mode:

  synth_power controls the thickness of the line
  
  synth_smooth = 1 skews the thickness a little. On some shapes this can 
    be an attractive effect.
    


mode 5: raw circle
-------------------

Applies just the synth shape in a circular manner without any other
combination.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

In this mode:

  synth_power is ignored
  
  synth_smooth = 1 makes the distortion less aggressive (and more like linear)
    near the origin or at a large distance from it.



mode 6: raw x
--------------

Applies the synth distortion to x yalues depending on the y position (imagine
a wave on the y axis which multiplies all the values in each row).

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

In this mode:

  synth_power is ignored
  
  synth_smooth = 1 makes the distortion less aggressive (and more like linear)
    near the y axis or at a large distance from it.



mode 7: raw y
--------------

Applies the synth distortion to y yalues depending on the z position (imagine
a wave on the x axis which multiplies all the values in each column).

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

In this mode:

  synth_power is ignored
  
  synth_smooth = 1 makes the distortion less aggressive (and more like linear)
    near the x axis or at a large distance from it.



mode 8: raw xy
--------------

Applies the synth distortion simultaneously to x yalues depending on the y
position and y values depending on the x position.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

In this mode:

  synth_power is ignored
  
  synth_smooth = 1 makes the distortion less aggressive (and more like linear)
    near the axis or at large distances from them.



mode 9: shift x
---------------

Adds the synth shape as a shift to x values depending on y. The difference 
between shift and raw modes is that shift adds values whilst raw multiplies
them.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

In this mode synth_power and synth_smooth are both ignored.



mode 10: shift x
----------------

Adds the synth shape as a shift to y values depending on x. The difference 
between shift and raw modes is that shift adds values whilst raw multiplies
them.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

In this mode synth_power and synth_smooth are both ignored.



mode 11: shift x&y
------------------

Applies "shift x" and "shift y" modes simultaneously.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

In this mode synth_power and synth_smooth are both ignored.



mode 12: blur ring
------------------

Creates a ring shape distorted by the synth effect.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make a simple circular ring.

  synth_power controls the thickness of the ring
  
  synth_smooth = 1 skews the thickness a little. On some shapes this can 
    be an attractive effect.



mode 13: blur ring 2
---------------------

Creates a ring shape distorted by the synth effect, similar to mode 12, but 
with a slightly different distribution of intensity.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make a simple circular ring.

  synth_power controls the thickness of the ring.
  
  synth_smooth has no effect.



mode 14: swirling
-----------------

Applies a rotation using the synth shape along an adjusted radius to decide
how far to rotate.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to see the effect simplified (I am not sure if this the
same as any other variation).

  synth_power controls how the radius is used.
  
  synth_smooth has no effect.



mode 15: shift tangent
----------------------

Uses the distance from the origin (0,0) to determine a tangential shift based
on the synth value. Imagine the waveform lying along a radius, and sweeping
around a circle - every point it touches is shifted perpendicular to the radius
depending on the height of the wave at the point.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

  synth_power controls how the radius is scaled (effectively this squashes or
    stretches the synth effect along the radius).
  
  synth_smooth has no effect.



mode 16: shift theta
--------------------

Uses the distance from the origin (0,0) to determine a rotation shift based
on the synth value. Imagine the waveform lying along a radius, and sweeping
around a circle - every point it touches is shifted around the circle
depending on the height of the wave at the point.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make it the same as linear.

  synth_power controls how the radius is scaled (effectively this squashes or
    stretches the synth effect along the radius).
  
  synth_smooth has no effect.



mode 17: mirror x
-----------------

Uses the synth waveform as a line which "reflects" points in the y axis. 

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make this a straight line along the x axis (very 
similar to an upside-down linear transform).

In this mode synth_power and synth_smooth are both ignored.



mode 18: mirror xy
------------------

Uses two synth waveforms as lines which simultaneously reflect points in 
the x and y axes.

Set synth_mix = 0.0 to make this two straight lines along the axes (very 
similar to a 180 degree rotated linear transform).

In this mode synth_power and synth_smooth are both ignored.



mode 19: spherical 2
--------------------

Modified version of spherical, but with different behaviour to mode 0.

In this mode:

  synth_power is used to adjust radial effects.
  
  synth_smooth = 1 makes the shape less different from circular
    near the centre or far out.
